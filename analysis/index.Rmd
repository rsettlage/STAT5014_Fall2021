Welcome to my the STAT 5014 website for Fall 2021.

On this site, you will find all the material we will go over in class, all assignments, and instructions for submitting homeworks.

What this class is: a 0-60 run-through of R for those of you who had more pen/paper programs prior to this.

What this class is not: a fundamentals of computing course.  

We do not dive deep into the inerts of R and how to squeeze performance out of it.  We do, however, talk about ways to do things more intentionally that may in indeed result in speed improvements.  More importantly, we discuss ways to organize yourself that are both Reproducible and adher to Good Programming Practices.  We also rely on Git to submit homeworks.  More on that in class.
