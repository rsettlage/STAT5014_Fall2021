## Today's Agenda

- Three objectives today
    + Automation
    + Reports
    + Dashboards: Flexdashboards and Shiny

## Automation

First, what do we mean by automation?  Push a button and good things happen, or do we want it to be more hands off?

A concrete example: after closing bell, you want to pull the daily open/close for a group of stocks making up your portfolio.  From the data, you want to create a nice summary table.

## Ways to automate a repetitive task:

    + cron (Windows Task Scheduler, Automator/Apple Script)  
    + HPC scheduler (Slurm, PBS/Torque, etc)  
    + GitHub !!
    
##  GitHub as automation platform (hijacking CI/CD)

CI/CD pipelines are a method of both development and delivery of software based solutions in a continuous manner.

"CI, short for Continuous Integration, is a product advancement practice in which all designers consolidate code changes in a focal storehouse on various occasions a day. CD represents Continuous Delivery, which over Continuous Integration includes the act of mechanizing the whole programming discharge process."

    + Improved deployment frequency  
    + Faster time to market  
    + Lower failure rate of new releases  
    + Shortened lead time between fixes  
    + Faster mean time to recovery (in the event of a new release crashing or otherwise disabling the current system)

GitHub has CI/CD pipelines built in in the form of actions that we can take advantage of.

## CI/CD parts


The functional parts of CI/CD pipelines consist of 3 key concepts: actions, tests, and 


    + Using version control for all production artifacts  
    + Monitoring system and application health  

## Create a skeleton CI/CD pipeline in GitHub

1. Create new repo  
2. Create file R/test.R (below) and file data/.placeholder  
3. Go to Actions, New Workflow, R package  
4. Change to  below: 

```
name: R

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0/5 * * * *"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        r-version: ['4.1.1']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up R ${{ matrix.r-version }}
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@f57f1301a053485946083d7a45022b278929a78a
        with:
          r-version: ${{ matrix.r-version }}
      - name: Generate data
        run: |
          source("R/test.R")
        shell: Rscript {0} 
      - name: Commit files
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "actions@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git add --all
          git commit
```

Note, this is written in YAML.  Proper indenting is strictly enforced and should be using two spaces per indent.  NOT tabs.  ":("

test.R:
```
test <- rnorm(5)
filename <- gsub(" ","_",gsub(':|- ', '_', Sys.time()),fixed=TRUE)
saveRDS(test, paste0("data/data-",filename,".RDS"))
```

## Doing actions on a schedule:

In the file .github/workflow/r.yml, you may have noticed:

```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0/5 * * * *"
```

This means, not only run the workflow on push/pull requests, but also on a schedule.  The above will run approximately every five minutes every day.

## Rendering Reports

Ok, so now we can generate random numbers at will (on push/pull), can we add to that?  What if we wanted to create a report that is rendered all nice and pretty and the report changes based on some input?

First, rendering via a script.  As a for instance, let's suppose we want to render the following Rmd, random.Rmd (I changed the ticks to render better, add the 3rd if you copy/paste):

```
---
title: "Draw Report"
author: "Robert Settlage"
output:
  pdf_document: default
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
---


``{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
library(knitr)
``

``{r get_numbers}
test <- rnorm(5)
``

``{r print_pretty}
kable(test,caption="5 random numbers")
``
```

As it turns out, we can render it via a command line call like so:

```
Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render(
    input= "R/random.Rmd",
    output_format = 'pdf_document,
    output_file   = 'random_draw.pdf',
    output_dir    = 'data/'))"
```

## Passing in parameters

Add to the YAML header:

```
params:
  use_seed: FALSE
  this_seed: 12345
```

Inside the Rmd, you can reference the parameters like so:

```
``{r set_params}
if(params$use_seed=="TRUE") then {
  set.seed(params$this_seed)
}
``
```

And the render call will change to include the params with desired settings:

```
Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render(
    input= "R/random.Rmd",
    output_format = 'pdf_document,
    output_file   = 'random_draw.pdf',
    output_dir    = 'data/'),
    params=list(use_seed="TRUE",this_seed=54321))"
```

## Dashboards

Collections of visuals to monitor or display a process are termed "Dashboards".

Dashboards are found in many fields in our daily lives:

1.  CDC - Center for Disease Control, all over on thier website  
2.  Stock trading platforms  
3.  The front of your car  
4.  Casinos  
5.  Airline control towers

## Interaction

Static dashboards are nice, interactive are better, REACTIVE are best.

1.  Static - load, munge, analyze, plot  
2.  Interactive - user can influence and explore data  
3.  Reactive - new data flows into the dashboard updates visuals accordingly
